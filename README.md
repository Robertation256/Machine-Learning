# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning Fall 2020 Project

1. For final project code, please refer to “/Final Project Code”

2. "/Early Progression and Trial" contains code of our early attempt at solving our problem with all different algorithms and preprocessing techniques, which might include invalid code.

3. "shiseng_crawler.py" is the crawler that we used to crawl job records from Shixiseng

4. During the implementation, Yuhang and I find it most effective to do pair programming, so all the code are results of both parties.
